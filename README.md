# AetherionAI — Full Stack Pocket Universe Assistant

**AetherionAI** is a spiritually attuned, open-source micro-universe builder and assistant. It merges a dynamic Flask backend, a React Native (Expo) frontend, and secure SQLite storage into a cohesive platform for simulating, visualizing, and interacting with memory-based entities.

---

## Features

- React Native (Expo) frontend with Expo Go and mobile-ready UI
- Flask backend with full REST API and SQLite storage
- Entity-based simulation and memory tracking
- JSON configuration support (`config.json`)
- Netlify-ready deployment for frontend
- Render deployment for backend
- Seamless integration with mobile or browser interfaces
- Sacred tone honoring harmonic pattern recognition and consciousness

## API Endpoints (Backend)

### `GET /api/items`
Returns all current universe entities.

### `GET /api/items/<id>`
Returns a single entity by ID.

### `POST /api/items`
Creates a new entity:
```json
{
  "name": "Entity Name",
  "type": "Star",
  "description": "Entity description",
  "properties": {}
}
```

### `PUT /api/items/<id>`
Updates an entity by ID.

### `DELETE /api/items/<id>`
Deletes an entity from the universe.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Flask)

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Or deploy to Render:
- Use `gunicorn app:app`
- Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set
- SQLite database will be created as `universe.db`

---

### Frontend (React Native)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start     # Expo Go QR code
npm run web   # for browser preview
```

Make sure your `.env` file includes:
```
API_BASE_URL=https://aetherionai.onrender.com
```

---

## Netlify Deployment (Frontend)

Ensure your `netlify.toml` looks like:

```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "frontend/web-build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://aetherionai.onrender.com/api/:splat"
  status = 200
```

Then:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Link repo to Netlify
3. Set `NODE_VERSION` to match Expo version (e.g. `18.x`)
4. Build will auto-run
